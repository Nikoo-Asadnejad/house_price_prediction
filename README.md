# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project implements a simple Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on features such as square footage and the number of bedrooms. The model is built using Python's `scikit-learn` library and demonstrates basic machine learning concepts.

## Features

- **Predicts House Prices**: Based on square footage and the number of bedrooms.
- **Linear Regression Model**: A simple machine learning algorithm for regression problems.
- **Model Training and Testing**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need to install the following Python libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
